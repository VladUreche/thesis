\section{Conclusions}
\label{mbox:sec-conclusions}
We described miniboxing, an improved specialization transformation in Scala, which significantly reduces the bytecode generated. Miniboxing consists of the basic encoding (\S\ref{mbox:sec-miniboxing}) and code transformation (\S\ref{mbox:sec-mb-traf}), the runtime support (\S\ref{mbox:sec-runtime}) and the specializing classloader (\S\ref{mbox:sec-classloading}). Together, these techniques were able to approach the performance of monomorphic and specialized code and obtain speedups of up to 22x over the homogeneous translation (\S\ref{mbox:sec-evaluation}).
