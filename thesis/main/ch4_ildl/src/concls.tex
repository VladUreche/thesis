\section{Conclusion \textcolor{white}{and an Easter Egg}}
\label{ildl:sec:concls}


In this chapter, we presented an intuitive interface over a safe and
composable programmer-driven data representation transformation, where
the composition works not only across source files but also across
separate compilation runs.
The transformation takes care of all the tedium involved in using a
different representation, by automatically introducing coercions and
bridge methods where necessary, and optimizing the code via extension
methods. Benchmarking the resulting transformation shows significant
performance improvements, with speedups between 1.8x and 24.5x. We
demonstrated our mechanism in the Scala language, yet speculate that
the same principles are applicable in different language settings.
