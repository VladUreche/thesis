\section*{Crash course to Vlad's \LaTeX tweaks}

\vlad{Feel free to make changes directly on the paper.} If you want to start a discussion, you can use |\yannis{text}| , |\aggelos{text}| or |\dima{text}|. The comment above was made using |\vlad{...}|. And you can change your color in the |tweaks.tex| file. Another two things:



\noindent Code: use |\begin{lstlisting-nobreak}|. Inside the code you can highlight using backquotes |`|:

\begin{lstlisting-nobreak}
  def `foo`: Int = `3`
\end{lstlisting-nobreak}

\noindent By the way, don't try to highlight starting from the first character, it looks ugly:

\begin{lstlisting-nobreak}
  `def foo`: Int = `3`
\end{lstlisting-nobreak}

\noindent Verbatim: use straight bars, like \verb=|=, e.g: \verb=|verbatim text|=.

My own comment, which does not reflect the views of my employer: The Springer template sucks compared to |sigplan.cls|!
