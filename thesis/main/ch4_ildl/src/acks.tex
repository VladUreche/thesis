We would like to thank Alexandru Nedelcu, whose comments inspired the initial work on miniboxed functions. The ADRT mechanism extends and generalizes the approach taken to introduce miniboxed functions in high-performance libraries. We are grateful to the members of the LAMP laboratory in EPFL for their extraordinary support, especially to Dmitry Petrashko, Heather Miller, Manohar Jonnalagedda and Sandro Stucki for their constructive feedback which shaped the project. We would like to thank Tom Switzer and Nicolas Stucki for building their applications on the miniboxing plugin and reporting the issues they came across. Vera Salvisberg and the OOPSLA reviewers provided helpful suggestions on improving the paper.
